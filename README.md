# Harnessing-Machine-Learning-to-Uncover-High-Performance-Magnetocaloric-Alloys
This is the code for the paper ‘Harnessing Machine Learning to Uncover High-Performance Magnetocaloric Alloys for Green Refrigeration’. 
Magnetic refrigeration is emerging as a promising alternative for conventional gas compression refrigeration. The key to advancing this technology lies in identifying materials with high magnetocaloric effect (MCE). However, traditional experimental methods require time-consuming and labor-intensive experimentation to screen compositions. Herein, we developed a machine learning (ML) model utilizing the Random Forest algorithm to efficiently identify MM'X alloy compositions with giant MCE near room temperature based on a small dataset (<200). The ML-predicted results were perfectly confirmed by the validation experiments. Notably, the entropy changes (∆S) for predicted alloys exceed 46 J·kg-1K-1 (0-5 T), more than four times higher than that of the benchmark material, Gd. The origin of this giant MCE is linked to lattice ∆S predominantly from Ni atoms, as confirmed through neutron powder diffraction and element-resolved vibrational density of states analysis. This work accelerates the discovery of magnetic refrigerants and significantly promoting the development of magnetic refrigeration.
